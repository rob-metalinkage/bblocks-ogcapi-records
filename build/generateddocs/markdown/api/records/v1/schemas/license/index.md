# Schema for license (Schema)

`ogc.api.records.v1.schemas.license` *v0.1*

This building block corresponds to the schema for an OGC API Records license

[*Status*](http://www.opengis.net/def/status): Under development

## Schema

```yaml
type: string
description: A legal document under which the resource is made available. If the resource
  is being made available under a common license then use an SPDX license id (https://spdx.org/licenses/).
  If the resource is being made available under multiple common licenses then use
  an SPDX license expression v2.3 string (https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/SPDX-license-expressions/)
  If the resource is being made available under one or more licenses that haven't
  been assigned an SPDX identifier or one or more custom licenses then use a string
  value of 'other' and include one or more links (rel="license") in the `link` section
  of the record to the file(s) that contains the text of the license(s). There is
  also the case of a resource that is private or unpublished and is thus unlicensed;
  in this case do not register such a resource in the catalog in the first place since
  there is no point in making such a resource discoverable.

```
