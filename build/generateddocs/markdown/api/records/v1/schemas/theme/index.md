# Schema for theme (Schema)

`ogc.api.records.v1.schemas.theme` *v0.1*

This building block corresponds to the schema for an OGC API Records theme

[*Status*](http://www.opengis.net/def/status): Under development

## Schema

```yaml
type: object
required:
- concepts
- scheme
properties:
  concepts:
    type: array
    description: One or more entity/concept identifiers from this knowledge system.
      it is recommended that a resolvable URI be used for each entity/concept identifier.
    minItems: 1
    items:
      type: object
      required:
      - id
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          description: An identifier for the concept.
        title:
          type: string
          description: A human readable title for the concept.
        description:
          type: string
          description: A human readable description for the concept.
        url:
          type: string
          format: uri
          description: A URI providing further description of the concept.
  scheme:
    type: string
    description: An identifier for the knowledge organization system used to classify
      the resource.  It is recommended that the identifier be a resolvable URI.  The
      list of schemes used in a searchable catalog can be determined by inspecting
      the server's OpenAPI document or, if the server implements CQL2, by exposing
      a queryable (e.g. named `scheme`) and enumerating the list of schemes in the
      queryable's schema definition.
