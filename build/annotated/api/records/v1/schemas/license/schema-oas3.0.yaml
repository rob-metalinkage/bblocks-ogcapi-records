    type: string
    description: A legal document under which the resource is made available. If the
      resource is being made available under a common license then use an SPDX license
      id (https://spdx.org/licenses/). If the resource is being made available under
      multiple common licenses then use an SPDX license expression v2.3 string (https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/SPDX-license-expressions/)
      If the resource is being made available under one or more licenses that haven't
      been assigned an SPDX identifier or one or more custom licenses then use a string
      value of 'other' and include one or more links (rel="license") in the `link`
      section of the record to the file(s) that contains the text of the license(s).
      There is also the case of a resource that is private or unpublished and is thus
      unlicensed; in this case do not register such a resource in the catalog in the
      first place since there is no point in making such a resource discoverable.
